TrueMedia Data Visualization Project
=====================================

Technology employed
--------------------
* AngularJS.
* Bootstrap/Angular Bootstrap UI
* Angular UI Router.
* Angular UI Grid.
* D3.
* Lots and lots of underscore.js for data manipulation.

Notable Features
-----------------
1. Despite having no backend, it is a true single page app. URLs represent application state. They respect browser history (they're even bookmarkable! Try it!)
2. D3 has been used with transitions to produce an animated bar graph.
3. State transitions are seamless. I only update the table or the graph if they need to be updated. This produces a smooth, continuous user experience.
4. Design is responsive. Layout changes to fit the viewport -- including the graph (that was tricky to do, to be honest!)
5. Underlying JavaScript is written at a very high quality. Much code has been encapsulated in JavaScript class files so that it could potentially be reused in other projects.
6. Table is fully filterable and sortable. Columns can be resized. You can even filter by teams. Neat!
7. Designed to allow for the easy addition of new players. Just add another element to playerData.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------
Extract the zip file somewhere. Load index.html in your browser. No server required. Have fun!
