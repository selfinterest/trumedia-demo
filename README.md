TrueMedia Data Visualization Project
=====================================

Technology employed
--------------------
* AngularJS.
* Bootstrap.
* Angular UI Router.
* Angular UI Grid.
* D3.
* Lots and lots of underscore.js for data manipulation.

Greetings, to whom it may concern. Here are some features my project demonstrates that I believe are notable:

1. Despite having no backend, it is a true single page app. URLs represent application state. They respect browser history (they're even bookmarkable! Try it!)
2. D3 has been used with transitions to produce an animated bar graph.
3. State transitions are seamless. I only update the table or the graph if they need to be updated. This produces a smooth, continous user experience.
4. Design is responsive. Layout changes to fit the viewport.
5. Underlying JavaScript is written at a very high quality. Much code has been encapsulated in JavaScript class files so that it could potentially be reused in other projects.
